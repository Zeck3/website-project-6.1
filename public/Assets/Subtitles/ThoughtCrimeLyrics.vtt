00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.520
You, who are so kind to others, could never understand this heart of mine.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.240
I enjoy cursing others, that used to be why I wrote songs.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.780
I had dreamt of being featured in the morning news, someday;

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
for that reason, I sharpen my knife.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.780
The sound of glass being smashed,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.320
the act of ripping apart some kind of paper,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.640
the setting sun after a farewell –

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.680
surely, even you understand that they're beautiful, right?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.260
The crows' song is dyed a deep red,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.420
and this loneliness, too, turns into sound.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.340
In the last traces of the dusk in my memory

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.300
You stand on your tiptoes; the clouds burn red,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.360
and the word "goodbye" slips from my mouth

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.540
I want to be acknowledged, I want to love–

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.520
are these what they call "dreams?"

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.020
Even if I do nothing to achieve them, let them come true.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.060
Hurry up and gratify me.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.220
Society, which is so kind to others, could never understand this envy.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.900
I'm always looking for an opportunity to hit someone.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.060
A streetlight struck by a bottle of beer, the sound of a guitar breaking after being thrown;

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.600
all these irreparable regrets are beautiful—

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.100
That said, even I understand! And yet...

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.220
I'm struck by a rain of words,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.580
and winter tumbles down on me even as I hold autumn dearly in my arms.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.480
From behind the mountain in spring,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.800
one more breath of smoke drifts upwards—

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.120
and the summer breeze slips across my cheek.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.980
You, who are so kind to others, could never understand this loneliness of mine.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.700
I don't want to die, but I can't go on living;

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.740
that's why I write songs.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.440
I think disparagement, disappointment, and disgust have all have their eyes on me.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.480
That's why I write songs that hurt people.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.820
That's why I write vapid songs such as this.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.020
I want to swallow your words.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.180
I don't even have anything to put them in,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.940
so I use both my hands.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.220
Before i know it my throat will get wet,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.620
And while I wait for that time to come...

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.280
The crows' song is dyed a deep red,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.140
and I plead for this loneliness to transform into song.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.580
The word "goodbye" dyes you a deep red,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.500
and, now, I wait for the night.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.160
The words "see you tomorrow" slip off my mouth.
