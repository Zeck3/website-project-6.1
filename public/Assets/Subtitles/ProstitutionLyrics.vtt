00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.000
It's okay, don't worry

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.240
Even if you sleep, things will work out somehow

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.500
What's wrong? Why are you making that face?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.500
There's nothing to worry about

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.040
I'm pointlessly waiting for love at the station

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.200
Cuz' I have nothing else to do, anyway

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.000
I want someone to teach me the value of insincerity

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Don't say a word! You better forget about things like love

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.100
Teach me anything, even painful things

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.900
If a single "mayfly" like this is "okay", it's better to forget

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.420
I can't listen to meaningless things only

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
I don't want to declare it

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.600
It's okay, no matter how much you throw up

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.800
Because words will never be enough

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.000
What's wrong? Don't you understand this sorrow?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.600
I'm pointlessly waiting for love at the front door

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.800
Gasping in a whispering voice

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.600
I want someone to teach me the pain of regret

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.560
You better also forget somehow about the "heat haze" and this day

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.600
Just sing me about love without the sad things

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.600
You better not to think what a single kiss for the end is "okay"

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.000
I can't even forget all the meaningless things

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.020
I don't want to know them

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.200
Someday, we will also forget about the "heat haze" and this day, right? (with regret)

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.040
It hurts

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.200
noruttururuttuturururururu

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.600
If that one hesitation is "love," then I'd rather not know about it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.000
Let me hear more of the "meaningless things"

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.800
Don't say a word! Please forget about things like "tomorrow"

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.000
Teach me about even painful things, how many times you want

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I want that "unpolished" "mayfly" so much what i "drown"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.400
Let me hear more of the "meaningless things"

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
I want to be loved

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.900
