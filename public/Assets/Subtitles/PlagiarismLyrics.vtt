00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.540
"What was it that got me into music, again?

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.060
Was it the record player that my dad had?

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.580
Listening feels good.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.120
Just listening doesn't require any effort, after all.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.160
A preface isn't needed,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.640
so I'll just get straight to the point–

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.800
One day, I thought:

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.040
Perhaps, this hole could be filled up if this song were to become mine.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.100
And so, I stole"

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.300
Ah, it's still not enough.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.760
Nothing's enough.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.560
I'm not satisfied at all.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.600
I won't be able to live alone if this goes on.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.220
I want to learn more.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.580
I want to learn of love

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.140
And of something

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.800
so beautiful it'll sate my heart.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.460
"One day, I realized

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.040
that the song playing all over town was my own.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440
Well, no wonder it became popular.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.020
I made it by stealing a masterpiece, after all!

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.340
That guy is an idiot.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.820
This guy is an idiot, too.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.020
Everyone who showers them with praises is an idiot as well.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.160
And the true value eludes the crowd,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.960
which flocks like crows.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.960
Well, I guess I'm the same as them"

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.080
Ah, something's still missing.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.780
I've stolen this much

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.860
but I'm not satisfied in the slightest.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.960
I can't be satisfied just with superficial words.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.920
I want to learn of love.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.860
Just money isn't enough.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.060
I want to learn of something

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.120
so beautiful it'll sate my jealousy.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.820
"What was it that got me into music?

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.060
I've forgotten already,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.820
but I remember that it wasn't greed.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.160
It was something beautiful.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.680
This mask I put on will come off one day.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.100
And despite all, the night will come.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.120
I'll be looking forward from the bottom

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.400
of my heart to what I'll see then.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.380
That's right.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.460
I lost everything–

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.600
status, love, it's all gone.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.640
I think the night after everything's gone

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.300
will be really beautiful

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.140
It will be really

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.820
really

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.920
beautiful

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.220
And that's why I stole"

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.880
Ah, it's still not enough.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.280
I want to write more.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.700
I won't be satisfied with this kind of song

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.540
Or the harsh words you lot spit out.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.340
I want to write about a love

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.660
I have yet to know

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.820
And to learn of something

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.020
so beautiful it'll sate my heart.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.020
It's still not enough.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.920
I'm not enough.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.900
I don't know what's always been missing.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.020
It's still not enough.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.240
I want to learn more.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.440
I want to learn of a night

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.220
so beautiful it'll melt my body away.
