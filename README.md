# Yorushika

I am not a thief but this work cannot determined if its plagiarized or not. It is merely made to enhance my skills on coding on Javascript/Typescript and React JS, on web development. And thus, as a fan of ヨルシカ (Yorushika), I made this playlist website (sort of) with minimal functionalities, and only a few songs from ヨルシカ used. I do not own the images, the videos, and their work.
